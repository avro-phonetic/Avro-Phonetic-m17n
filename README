m17n-db for Popular Bangla writing engine Avro Phonetic

This is created as there is no support currently for Avro Phonetic in IBus.
With this file (bn-avro-phonetic.mim), now we can use avro phonetic in IBus.

How to use with IBus -
 Install this first (see the file INSTALL).
 Also install ibus-m17n
 Then open "Keyboard Input Methods". Go to "Input Method".
 Add Avro.
 Now you can use Avro with IBus :-)
